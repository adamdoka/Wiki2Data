# Wiki2Data - Data Extractor from MediaWiki sites (e.g. Wikipedia)

The project's goal is to have an extractor that can gather data from mediawiki pages using templates. You can look for multiple templates and variables at once. The results then can be saved into a csv. There is also a section (part 3) which helps make an analysis of all existing templates in the pages you are interested in.

## Prerequisites
